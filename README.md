## Integration with Your Python Model
### Running the API python file
Run the app:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### API Endpoints
The model is trained through a custom data given by the hackathon and its been reshaped for better performance
(check the model.ipynb file)
The app is designed to integrate with our Python backend through these endpoints:

```
POST /generate-plan          # Generate fitness plan
POST /generate-nutrition     # Generate nutrition plan
POST /save-progress         # Save user progress
GET  /progress/:userId      # Get progress history
POST /generate-meals        # Generate meal suggestions
POST /calculate-calories    # Calculate calorie needs
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Input**: Comprehensive profile form captures user data
2. **API Call**: Send profile data to your Python model
3. **Plan Generation**: Receive personalized fitness and nutrition plans
4. **Display**: Beautiful UI presents the plans to users
5. **Tracking**: Monitor progress and sync with backend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Your Python API backend

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Update API URL in `lib/services/api_service.dart`
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Backend Integration
1. Replace `YOUR_PYTHON_API_URL` in `api_service.dart` with your actual API URL
2. Ensure your Python API accepts the JSON format defined in `UserProfile.toJson()`
3. Update response parsing in API service methods to match your backend response format
4. Used Supabase as DataBase that ensures users safety through RLS

## Customization

### Theming
- Modify colors in `main.dart` and individual widgets
- Update gradients throughout the app for brand consistency
- Customize fonts by changing Google Fonts selections

### Features
- Add new workout types in `mock_data.dart`
- Extend user profile fields in `user_profile.dart`
- Create additional tracking metrics in progress tracker

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Lists use efficient builders
- **State Management**: Minimal rebuilds with proper state handling
- **Image Optimization**: No embedded images, uses icons and gradients
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and animations

## Future Enhancements
